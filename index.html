                    Here we're going to go through the workflow of redesigning a simple website. We will analyze and
                    identify flaws in an existing interface, create
                    low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes, and build a responsive website
                    based
                    on those prototypes!

                        I chose to redesign this website for MetroNails, a nail salon in Providence. I encountered this
                        website last
                        year when looking for nail salons near Brown University. I
                        immediately noticed it looked outdated, unprofessional and wasn't easy to use.

                    <div class="paragraph-text">
                        <strong>Efficiency: </strong>
                        &nbsp; Even users who are familiar with this site would have to
                        scroll and navigate
                        to multiple tabs to get the information they are most interested in. Because there are
                        no clear headings for each section of information and the text is not in an easily recognizable
                        pattern, even familiar users may have to read multiple sections to get the
                        information they are looking for.
                    </div>

                    <div class="paragraph-text">
                        <strong>Learnability: </strong>
                        &nbsp; The hours of operation, services available and method of
                        booking all are hidden within paragraphs of text and are not obvious to a first time user. The
                        variation in
                        font,size and color of text also makes it jarring for first time users.It would
                        take multiple visits to the site to remember where to look.
                    </div>

                    <div class="paragraph-text">
                        <strong>Memorability: </strong>
                        &nbsp; A user encountering this interface who was once familiar
                        with the site does not have much advantage over a first time user. There are no icons or
                        other
                        elements that would make a user instinctively look at a given portion of the site.
                    </div>

                    <div class="paragraph-text">
                        <strong>Aesthetically: </strong>
                        &nbsp; Generally this interface has an unpleasant aesthetic
                        experience. Overall
                        as an interface this did not feel intuitive for me as a user. I think especially for a
                        service where artistry and aesthetics are important their website must be up to a
                        certain standard. As mentioned previously there should be more consistency with the style, size,
                        font and color of the text.
